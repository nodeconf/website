    <h2 class="mt3">NodeConf Adventure</h2>
    <p class="mb4">The word most often used to describe Walker Creek Ranch is "magical." This will be the 8th year we've run an event there. In the earliest days of Node we did un-conferences called "NodeConf SummerCamp" which were collaborative events where Node leaders talked through the future of the project. In recent years we've used the venue to provide more "hands-on" learning and community building which helped create and grow NodeSchool.</p>
    <p>NodeConf Adventure is the latest in our hands-on series. It is a family friendly event that invites a large portion of the Node community leadership to work together in a relaxed environment.</p>
